## My Project

My aim is to create an awesome functioning website using GitHub Pages and some basic HTML/MD code knowledge. 

In the past I have created several websites [iJailbreak - Discontinued](http://ijailbreak.ml)
and [my personal website](http://dylan736.weebly.com) made for my school project - also discontinued. Neither of these sites were amazing, both became boring and needed little to no skill to create - my grandma could probably make one. It’s not to say that Weebly or Wordpress or similar website creators are bad, but I wanted to delve a bit deeper into the coding side of websites - being the self-taught computer enthusiast I am. 

### About

I am a 13 year old self-proclaimed computer enthusiast from near Birmingham, UK. I have little to no coding knowledge besides a few things I have taught myself - I can code HTML, but that is limited, and anyway, other languages are superior nowadays and more user-friendly. I guess that is what this website is for me, an experiment and a project for me to practise my skills, and who knows, one day I might need coding for future jobs.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Distify/distify/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
